## 5 Video Scripts (Hormozi-Style)

### Video 1: PROBLEM
**Type:** Pain-focused  
**Length:** 30 seconds  
**Best for:** Cold traffic, awareness

```
[Screen: Instagram DM notifications piling up]

VOICEOVER:
"9pm. Your clinic is closed.
But your Instagram has 12 unread messages.

'What time do you open?'
'How much is a consultation?'
'Can I book for tomorrow?'

By morning, 3 of them messaged your competitor.

What if these messages answered themselves... in 20 seconds?"

[Show VetFlow bot responding instantly]

"VetFlow AI. $600/month. 14-day free trial."
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Start with phone screen, notifications stacking
- Show message previews
- Transition to bot responding
- End with logo + CTA

---

### Video 2: MONEY/CALCULATOR
**Type:** Loss aversion / ROI  
**Length:** 45 seconds  
**Best for:** Decision makers, clinic owners

```
[Screen: Calculator app or animated numbers]

VOICEOVER:
"Let's do the math on your unanswered messages.

Your clinic gets 50 messages per week.
30% come after hours — that's 15 messages.
Half of those are ready to book.

7 potential clients × $100 average visit = $700/week.
$2,800/month you're LEAVING on the table.

VetFlow costs $600.

You're losing $2,200 every month by NOT using it.

14-day free trial. Link in bio."

[Show bot booking appointment at 11pm]
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Calculator on screen, numbers appearing
- Could animate the math
- Show the contrast: $2,800 lost vs $600 investment
- End with demo of bot booking

---

### Video 3: BEFORE/AFTER
**Type:** Transformation  
**Length:** 30 seconds  
**Best for:** Visual comparison, social proof

```
[Split screen]

LEFT SIDE - BEFORE:
"It's 10pm. Client messages on WhatsApp:
'Can I book a consultation for tomorrow?'

Nobody responds.
Morning comes. Client already booked elsewhere."

RIGHT SIDE - AFTER:
"It's 10pm. Same message.

VetFlow responds in 20 seconds:
'Of course! I have 2pm and 4pm available. Which works?'

Client books. Shows up. Pays."

[Full screen]
"The difference? $600/month.
Try free for 14 days."
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Split screen side by side
- Left side: red X, sad music, message left on read
- Right side: green checkmark, upbeat, booking confirmed
- Merge to full screen for CTA

---

### Video 4: OBJECTION HANDLER
**Type:** Address fears / overcome resistance  
**Length:** 40 seconds  
**Best for:** Warm traffic, retargeting

```
[Face to camera or text on screen]

VOICEOVER:
"'But my clients want to talk to a REAL person...'

I hear this every time.

Let me ask you:
When you message a clinic at 10pm, do you expect a human?
Or do you just want an ANSWER?

VetFlow handles the boring stuff:
- Hours
- Prices  
- Booking

Your staff handles the REAL conversations:
- Emergency cases
- Complex questions
- Angry clients

AI handles 90%. Humans handle 10%.
Your admin finally has time to breathe.

$600/month. Free trial. Link in bio."
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Could be talking head (you) or text overlays
- Show the split: boring vs important
- Emphasize human takeover feature

---

### Video 5: URGENCY/COMPETITION
**Type:** FOMO / Fear of missing out  
**Length:** 25 seconds  
**Best for:** Cold traffic, action-oriented

```
[Screen: Multiple vet clinic Instagram pages]

VOICEOVER:
"While you're sleeping...
Your competitor's bot is booking appointments.

3am message: 'My dog is limping, can I come tomorrow?'

Your clinic: [seen at 9am, client already gone]
Their clinic: 'Absolutely! 10am works. See you then.'

AI is not the future. It's NOW.

$600/month. Try free. Link in bio."
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Fast cuts between different clinic pages
- Show the contrast: your empty inbox vs competitor's booked calendar
- Create sense of urgency

Interview or quote from BioNika Vet Clinic about their results.

### Idea 8: Setup Speed
"How fast can you go live? 72 hours from first call to working bot."

### Idea 9: Feature Spotlight
Focus on ONE feature: human takeover, calendar booking, or multi-language.

### Idea 10: Social Proof Compilation
Screenshots of happy clinic owners' messages about results.

## AI Video Generation Prompts

*(To be added — prompts for generating these videos with AI tools)*

---

## Notes

- All videos should be vertical (9:16) for Stories/Reels
- First 3 seconds = hook (most important!)
- Always end with clear CTA: website, "link in bio", "DM for demo"
- Test multiple thumbnails for each video

## NEW: Story-Style Script (Based on Deep Research)

> Created: January 3, 2026
> Style: Personal story / conversational
> Based on: Customer research about vet clinic pain points

### Video 6: "11pm Message" (RECOMMENDED)
**Type:** Story / Personal  
**Length:** 60 seconds  
**Best for:** Cold traffic, emotional connection

```
VOICEOVER:

It's 11pm. You're finally relaxing.

*ding*

"Hi! What time do you open tomorrow?"

You could Google that. But they texted you instead.

Will anyone answer this at 11pm? Probably not.

That's exactly why I built an AI receptionist.

It answers this question in 20 seconds.
And every other question — based on the info you give us.

Your address. Your prices. Your services. Your FAQs.
We set it all up. The bot knows everything you tell us.

Plus, it books appointments straight to your Google Calendar.

And if someone asks something the bot doesn't know?

No guessing. No diagnosing. No risky advice.
Just: "Please call us during business hours" — with your number included.

It's not template answers. It's a smart AI that knows 
what to say, when to say it, and when to step back.

Now think about it — 
how many of these easy questions hit your Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp every day?

They can be answered. They SHOULD be answered. Fast.

So your admin doesn't lose their mind.
So you don't lose the client who messaged 5 clinics 
and went to the one that replied first.

VetFlow AI. $600 a month. 14-day free trial.
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Start with phone screen at 11pm, relaxing scene
- Show notification popup with message
- Transition to bot responding
- Show calendar booking automatically
- Show bot politely redirecting complex questions
- End with multiple messages being handled
- Logo + CTA
